# Hubot Against Humanity

CAH implemented in hubot form. I take no credit for this implementation. I am merely moving this script from the old hubot world to the new NPM-packaged one.

## Usage

Someone types `hubot q card`, and then everyone does `hubot card me` (or `hubot card me 2`, if it's a take-two).

## Installation

Add the package `hubot-humanity` as a dependency in your Hubot package.json file. Then add `hubot-humanity` to the list in the `external-scripts.json` file.
